# How to Whisper


A one stop shop for all things Whisper. The primary goal of this repository is to provide an easy gateway to run inference and fine-tune Whisper for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) using Hugging Face and ecosystem libraries.

This repository was primarily created for a workshop delivered at PyCon Italy, but is not just limited to it.

1. What is ASR and why is it hard?
2. Fine-tune Whisper on a language of your choice.
3. Run inference with your fine-tuned/ Whisper model.

### What is (Whisper)[https://openai.com/research/whisper] and why should you be excited about it?
Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. It enables transcription in multiple languages, as well as translation from those languages into English.
