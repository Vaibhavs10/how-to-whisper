# How to Whisper


A one stop shop for all things Whisper. The primary goal of this repository is to provide an easy gateway to run inference and fine-tune Whisper for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) using Hugging Face and ecosystem libraries.

This repository was primarily created for a workshop delivered at PyCon Italy, but is not just limited to it.

1. What is ASR and why is it hard?
2. Fine-tune Whisper on a language of your choice.
3. Run inference with your fine-tuned/ Whisper model.

Enjoyed the Workshop contents and want to take your fine-tuning game to the next level: https://github.com/Vaibhavs10/fast-whisper-finetuning ðŸ¤—
